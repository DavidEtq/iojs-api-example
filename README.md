# IO.js API REST

Building an API RESTfull written in ECMAScript6 on IO.js

## Requeriments

Install [IO.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) on your machine, I'm using NVM (Node Version Manager) to
install Node and Io.js and use both:

### Install NVM

To install you could use the install script using cURL:

```
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.4/install.sh | bash
```
or Wget:

```
$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.4/install.sh | bash
```
The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm` and adds the source line to your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.profile`).

### Install latest version of IO.js (v2.3.1)

```
$ nvm install v2.3.1
$ nvm use v2.3.1
```
